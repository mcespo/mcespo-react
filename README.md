# mcespo.com using React and GatsbyJS
The default Gatsby starter.

Oh hello,

Welcome to my very bad website. Designed, developed, and quickly built out by yours truly. I love static sites and any excuse I could potentially use to make something happen is more than I could ever hope for. This is where Gatsby comes into play. [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a framework used to generate static sites with react (as opposed to something like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for instance).

If you want to see how this puppy was built, please feel free to download and run `gatsby build` and `gatsby serve` on the command line (assuming you have node and gatsby installed in your machine).

Kay. Das it. I'll add more to the doc once I push further along with this work.
