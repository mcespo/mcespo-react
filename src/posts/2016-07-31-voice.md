I am a person who is driven by fear. For as long as I have been alive, insecurity and uncertainty has kept me from striving for much of anything in my career. That feeling has kept me anxious, constantly doubting my skills, and my worth. It never changed much as I grew older and it’s kept me from commitment for just as long. I think it’s why I find it necessary to write about my fears every so often (and I do write about fear often enough that my loved ones are numb to hearing me talk about it at this point). Recognizing and embracing weaknesses is one of the ways to overcome them, and I am about to step into a place where fear should cripple me, and for once in my life, it’s not.

I was 17 when I dropped out of high school with only months left before being flown to California from my home in Chicago. I was joining the Marine Corps and it was still possible for me to enlist in the military despite not having a diploma. I don’t know why I never finished school. Maybe I somehow believed I had done nothing to earn it, or maybe I was just at peak teen-angst mode. Honestly, there was no real excuse. Doing nothing had always been where I felt the most comfortable -and for the record, adult Marvin would gladly punch young Marvin in the face if the opportunity could ever present itself.

As much of a shit-stain as I had been growing up, the military certainly had it effects on my disposition despite the fact that I was never good at being a Marine. You can go down the line and most of my colleagues would say that I was timid, and lacked a lot of common sense (which was very true), especially under pressure. The reality is that the military never really fit my personality. I was still trying to figure things out for myself while hoping that the Marine Corps could somehow instill confidence in me. I matured certainly, but it was at the expense of traumatic events while deployed overseas. Regardless, the military was the first time I felt independent and capable of commitment (also, being contractually obligated to obey the federal government else run the risk of being arrested for insubordination is a hell of a motivational tool). What I had not realized at the time was how influential the internet had been in my life at that time, and how it was just as responsible for keeping me distracted enough from succumbing to fear as much then as it is now.

While in the military would constantly make time for IGN or Gizmodo (among other sites), and never realized that I became progressively obsessed with online media. It was therapeutic to read blogs that revolved around a hobby (in my case: video games, technology, and anime). For whatever reason, blogs kept me distracted. It felt like I wasn’t alone when I would hit refresh on a site and a new article was published. It made me feel like I still lived back home even if I was miles away from my friends and family.

Though the military never really dispelled my insecurities, it at least gave me a sense of maturity. One of the first things I did after my service ended was immediately start taking college classes while trying working on my GED alongside. At the time, DeVry was the one school that seemed open to accepting me and had a program that really seemed interesting at the time. As such, I was on the path to becoming a multimedia web designer.

The curriculum DeVry was less than perfect. It was the schools’ first year running a web design program and few of the instructors were qualified to even teach the subject. Worse was the fact that I started romanticizing the idea of working at an online media outlet as a journalist, which made me question why exactly I was trying to learn web design in the first place. In my mind, I assumed that I would work for IGN, 1UP, Engadget, Gizmodo, Destructoid -any site that would take me, but fear and uncertainty in my writing abilities were enough to keep me from ever transitioning fields(given the poor use of punctuation and run-on sentences in this post, I don’t entirely regret that decision). Not much changed after graduation. I would do some broad level of design and development work, read online media articles, and just let time slip away. I think I was insecure about being a developer and even more so about being a writer. What I failed to see was how relevant my education would be in this “journalism” world I loved so much.

One day while browsing through an IGN article, I spotted a code-related error and reached out to their support team. An hour or so later I ended up getting a message from one of their developers whom ended his reply with, “Thanks for the heads up. You should consider joining our dev team in the future.” Somehow, in that very moment, I never felt so small. All this time, I had assumed I could only contribute to a blog site as a journalist with no experience, but here I was learning how to work with the web, never once considering that an **ONLINE** media outlet would require web designers and developers among their staff.

So, I committed to being a contract web developer. I would take on small projects, jump between jobs, and constantly shift between design and development work. No matter how many roles or contracts I would accept, the constant emotion I held was fear and insecurity from application to application. I never felt comfortable being a designer, and more so a developer, but the goal of working at a media organization was always there. I had already made the habit of visiting these sites on a daily basis since I was in high school that it was nearly impossible to forget.
The company that had my heart for years was IGN but it would require me to move to California if I were to ever consider working there. Given my pending nuptials at the time, my wife would not like the idea of moving to another state given her attachment to Chicago (…and the newly signed mortgage to our first house was probably a factor as well). What company would be comfortable with me not being able to move? How many media outlets have Chicago offices, or allowed for remote work? Like some sort of sick poetry, I felt just as small for failing to realize I’d known the answer for well over a year now. My browser’s homepage was the newly launched gaming site, “Polygon”, and it never clicked in my mind until that moment.

I’m going to deviate for just a moment… One of the sites that I visited obsessively was Engadget. It was a site that somehow always hit the right buttons. It was fun to read, I enjoyed the editors, I loved listening their series of podcasts, and I dunno, it just made me happy. However, the site had gone through a change at some point. Many of the key figures of the editorial staff had left the company in a somewhat abrupt manner due to disputes regarding their work. Fast-forward ahead to the former staffs new temporary site known as, “This is My Next”, then the eventual launch of their proper website, “The Verge” alongside their newly established parent company, “Vox Media”. I visited The Verge constantly. Almost obsessively (…actually, it was obsessive and very creepy as I’ve come to re-read my old Twitter messages and emails while drafting this article). I’ve always believed the Verge was one of the greatest sites I had come to read in recent memory. Almost a year later, in a somewhat similar fashion, key figures from Joystiq had left to form their new video game site (under the Vox Media umbrella), aptly named, “Polygon.”

Vox Media was an up and coming online media conglomerate that had some of its small but growing staff work remotely (to include certain design and development positions). The idea of working here seemed crazy, but honestly, it seemed perfect. So perfect that I almost gave up on the idea instantly. I never held a steady job as a contractor, in fact it was always work that only lasted a few months at best. I never had the pleasure to collaborate with other designers or developers, so most of my skills were still being built and lacked a lot of polish. I also never really committed to a specific practice of the web because I enjoyed them all: design, development, SEO, UX, it was all fascinating to me. Even more evident was the fact that Vox Media could hire from literally anywhere on the globe. How could I possibly compete? Just like that, I gave up. I never really sent a resume until years later. When I finally did (partially because I was inebriated) it in 2014 for a position I was less than qualified for. It took nearly two years (and alcohol) for me to submit an application. Uncertainty and fear won yet again.

Not long after, I had the opportunity to work as a contract developer for Grainger. That company was a blast and it was my first real exposure as a dedicated front-end developer. It was slow and steady but it started to build my confidence. In a short span of time, and a plethora of online classes, I just randomly decided to submit my next application to Vox in 2015 alongside an email to their development director regarding the company. I didn’t have any expectations. The position seemed like it was sitting on their site for a while, and they already hired for the role when I applied. Even so, it felt fantastic to just submit a resume, and just as awesome to get a reply from their director. I think that was my turning point. When another opening appeared in early 2016, I applied again, and got a chance to interview. Needless to say I will never forget this moment for as long as I live…
I had the pleasure of meeting two Vox Media lead developers for an online interview regarding a front-end engineering position. After all this time, the contract jobs, and studying were starting to payoff. The meeting went well, and the two individuals were the nicest people I had come to meet from Vox (well, also Chris Ziegler but we passively just met at a bar). My second interview (also online) required me to answer some general web development questions and take a short test in front of four members of the development team immediately after. When it came time, I answered most of the questions poorly, and failed the exam so beautifully, one would question if I even knew how to code at all. This was one of the longest interviews I’ve had in my life. The pockets of uncomfortable silence were so intense I had to just concentrate on the sounds of my keyboard to keep from having a panic attack in front of everyone. Just like that, the second interview was over. I kept my composure, thanked them for the opportunity, and closed my computer. I had to sit in disbelief as I began to tear-up. I had the courage to get all the way up to this point, but not enough to take a test in front of anyone. I somehow made up the idea that this company was going to be my dream job -the fact that I’d not considered the possibility of caving under pressure was naive at best. I went to my room and took a nap to try and fend off one of the heaviest migraines I’ve had in a while. I awoke roughly around midnight and remembered that I still left the the exam open in my browser. The only thing that ran in my mind after everything was, “It’s not going to fucking end like this!”

I decided to redo the exam from the beginning with a timer, get as far as I possibly could with just a few web related articles open on the side, and made a small writeup to broadly explain how I tried to solve the test. I knew it was too late to try again, I had lost my chances and I had no expectation of thinking that this would somehow get me the job. That was never my reason for wanting to redo the exam. I submitted the redo to the team shortly thereafter and although they did decide to go with another candidate, the thing that kept picking the back of my neck was the fact that I made it this far in a short span of time. I got to interview with Vox Media after three attempts, I passed my first interview, I bombed my second one, and that was it: Life moved on. Did I think I was going to be banned from applying again? Why didn’t I fail sooner? Fear just beat me to a pulp and then nothing happened once the dust settled. It was surreal. So surreal that it became blinding. I knew I could do it. As ridiculous, admittedly disturbing, and foolish as it was to be this driven over working at a company, it wasn’t impossible, and that was enough to push me.

It’s strange to somehow believe that working for some business can be your dream job. It doesn’t make a lot of sense actually. Blindly pursuing the possibility to work for Google, or Apple, or any company really is an extremely dangerous outlook to have. Who’s to say that a company is doing good when good is relative to the needs of the business? The work, the growth, the people, the culture, everything could actually be morally or psychologically inadequate. My reasons or aspirations have more to do with the fact that I was never motivated by anything before this point. Hardly anything in my professional career ever felt as certain as my personal life. Even so, I always had admired and eventually became sold on the idea of working for Vox, and I felt then what still I feel now: assurance.

Another opening at Vox Media appeared in the tail end of spring 2016. I applied and was able to set up an interview, but something had already changed in the process. Something felt distinctly different. The application, the interview, the small talks online -it all seemed strange. I felt confident. Not about getting the job (that’s just arrogant), but that I felt ready. It wasn’t hopeful applications, it wasn’t shots in the dark while I held figurative prayer beads. I felt confident more than any point in my life that this is what I wanted to do, this is where I want to work, and above all else, that this was my choice.

That choice taught me so much about myself. It taught me that despite how much I constantly doubt my abilities, constantly feel anxious about my actions or decisions, and constantly carry the worst case of imposter syndrome nested deep in my psyche, it will never overshadow my aspirations (if I have any). I was able to make it this far with the love, support, and patience of every single person I have come to know in all these years of trying to figure shit out. My friends, my family, my coworkers, my jobs, my successes, and my failures are what made me who I am, and it finally started to click.

There is no guarantee that any job we have will be great or that we’ll ever fit. There is no guarantee that the company culture won’t change, that your priorities won’t evolve, or that a business won’t go under. That has never been the point in my mind. My reasons for wanting to work for a large media organization have been personal, and that’s all it needed to be. When I didn’t know what I wanted in life, these dumb sites were always here for me. Even if we could chop them up to being distractions from facing problems, media sites provided me a level of support that I intend to pay back in any conceivable way if the opportunity could present itself. If anything, I put myself in an unusual situation where I probably can’t afford to be shitty at my dream job -like not even a little bit. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
Even so, I have to say that I’m moments away from one of the greatest changes in my life and I have no idea if it will be good, if I will be good, or if it will even work out. All I know is that I am not even remotely afraid. Of that I am certain.
