My recent contract role came to an end yesterday. As much as I enjoyed my position with my employer, I was fairly certain I was not going to be extended. The workload was rapid. So much so that there was barely any time to test my websites against browsers before there were one or two more sites I needed to build in my queue. I’m not upset nor am I disappointed despite this. I never had the chance to do a proper interview with this position and the day that I came into the office with my portfolio, they already had a desk ready for me. The work was so backed-up on their end that they just needed bodies, and I just happened to show up at the right time.

I’m glad I got a chance to really do the best possible work I could. It was one of the few times I was independent and had to solve most of my issues on my own. It’s rare that I get a job where I am bombarded with so much work on a daily basis. I spent weeknights and even weekends trying to keep up with projects and learn new techniques by the minute. With every ounce of stress that started to bubble as the weeks progressed, I become that much more seasoned and confident. Regardless of whatever came my way, I never ceased or faltered.

I owe this realization to my employer. I owe them the one thing that I never knew was a skill. For the first time in my life, I finally began to understand that being **tenacious** truly meant, and how I made that my mantra for the remainder of my contract.

So what now? As it stands, it’s on to the next role where I get to finally put it all together and do the best fucking work I can do. On to the job where I get to illustrate my strengths, weaknesses and all that make me who I am today. On to the next best thing.
