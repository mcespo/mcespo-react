    <WelcomeMessage>
      Oh Hai! My name is Marvin and I design and develop websites n’ stuff.
    </WelcomeMessage>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>I am a frontend developer, web designer, and aspiring fullstack developer residing in beautiful (and mostly chilly) Chicago, Illinois. I volunteer as a designer, developer, and webmaster for the nonprofit organizations, “<a href="http://a4th.org/" title="A4TH website">Artists for the Humanities</a>” and, “<a href="https://intersectionchicago.org/" title="Intersection Chicago website">Intersection</a>.” I am also an instructor/TA for, "<a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/chicago" title="GDI Chicago Chapter website">Girl Develop It Chicago</a>", and occasionally tutor frontend development online.</p>
    <p>I also do freelance photography/video work, am at the beck and call of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZmbSzFnZu1/?taken-by=mcespo.jpeg" title="Meli the Golden, Instagram image">golden retriever</a>, and make <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/zpfd9aEbwo/?taken-by=mcespo.jpeg" title="Marvin Macchiato, Instagram image">wicked-good coffee</a>.</p>
    <p>Now that we have all the housekeeping taken care of, feel free to click around at some of my projects, my blog that I totally maintain consistantly, or why not <a href="mailto:mcespo@gmail.com?&amp;subject=Oh%20hello%20Marvin,%20you're%20so%20cool!&amp;body=I%20wish%20to%20be%20marginally%20as%20attractive%20as%20you%20are.%20Please%20help!%20Also,%20I%20wanted%20to%20ask..." title="Email Marvin Cespedes, and tell him all of your dreams">ask me for something</a>?</p>
